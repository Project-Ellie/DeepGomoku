    "# Philosophy\n",
    "- Alpha Epsilon (=almost zero) is about policy-advised graph search\n",
    "- MCTS is system II, policy is System I\n",
    "- It's only the policy/intuition that learns\n",
    "- Backpropagation with UCT is the most crucial bit of the entire setup\n",
    "- UCT produces the more successful value/policy estimates that the next generation then learns from\n",
    "- Information flows from the environment via UCT into the policy\n",
    "- The policy needs not know the best move - only the best set of options to feed into the MCTS\n",
    "\n",
    "# References\n",
    "- Take some time to make a comprehensive list of resources!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Aspects\n",
    "- Heuristics: bias vs efficiency trade-off\n",
    "- Board representation NxNx3 with boundary, symmetries\n",
    "- Tools: Understanding mean seeing it before your inner eyes.\n",
    "- Network design: Heuristic minimal features - RESNET + re-injection\n",
    "- Selfplay: Avoiding Early bias, go massively parallel\n",
    "- MCTS or rather \"Graphsearch with upper confidence bound\"\n",
    "- The Player = MCTS + Policy: What hyperparameters to know: cpuct, temperature, cut-off\n",
    "- The Alpha Zero life cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "- # Training:\n",
    "- Expressiveness\n",
    "- Overfitting - apparently not so much of an issue - large dataset!\n",
    "- Curriculum\n",
    "    - frequently changing the *subject* helps! But it's not strictly necessary\n",
    "    - terminal opportunities are rare (only once per trajectory, but they should not be missed!\n",
    "- Regularization\n",
    "    - changing training subjects, is it regularizing?\n",
    "- Generalization\n",
    "- Frustration: Gentle warmup for freshlings\n",
    "- What about a smarter loss function, if the policy as *just* adviser?\n",
    "- Trading policy loss vs value loss, jumps during training, if curriculum with different courses.\n",
    "- Local (Gomoku) vs global (Go) game type\n",
