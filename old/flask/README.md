This little side project is based on the example provided in Miguel Grindbergs excellent [socketio implementation for flask](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO/).
I removed all the cool stuff that I didn't need in the first place, but I want to mention it here as a reminder - just in case...:

- broadcast messages
- background threads in the server
- the 'room' concept: isolated sub-sessions
- a simple login page in sessions.html
